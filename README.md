The goal of this project was to use natural language processing to analyze hip hop's two biggest rappers: Biggie and Tupac. 

The main steps were:

Webscrapped all lyrics from Biggie and Tupac's Albums, including posthumous albums, into dataframe
Cleaned the lyrics, added stopwords, removed intercludes and repeat choruses
Created model and looked at lyrical trends over time for both artists
Used topic modeling (non-negative matrix factorization) to examine common themes amongst America's two biggest rappers
