The goal of this project was to use natural language processing to analyze hip hop's two biggest rappers: Biggie and Tupac. 

The main steps were:

Webscrap all lyrics from Biggie and Tupac's Albums, including posthumous albums
Train a model being able to predict and create data for Flask app to use
Link Spotiy's API to try out the model on any song in their library
Each of the links above is a Jupyter Notebook file with Python code to complete each step.
